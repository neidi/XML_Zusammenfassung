\begin{itemize}
\item JSON is more compact, easier to read and write for humans
\item JSON is a data exchange format; XML a markup language
\item JSON is better suited for data-centric use; XML is equally well suited for data-centric, document-centric and hybrid use
\item XML knows object references (id attribute)
\item XML Schema and JSON Schema* allow to define own languages.
But XML Schema knows complex data types and references
\item XPATH and XQuery extract information efficiently from deeply nested XML documents
\item XSLT enables automatic transformation of XML into different output formats (not necessarily XML)
\end{itemize}
